\experience{ML Engineer Intern}{Gojek}{Mar 2020}{Oct 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  % skills: Software Engineering, Security, ODIC, Java, Golang, Performanace
  \item Made 43 contributions \footnote{https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/commits?author=mrzzy} 
    to the open source Feast ML Feature Store, including ODIC based access control to the Feast's Java 
    \& Golang SDKs, enhancing data security without affecting latency.

  % skills: Redis, Protobuf
  % soft-skills: problem-solving, analytical
  \item Identified root cause of decoding error when with serving data from Redis.
    Fixed issue by replacing Protobuf position-based encoding with key-based encoding
    \footnote{https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/pull/908}.

  % skills: software testing
  \item Rigourously tested written code with extensive unit, integration \& end to end tests,
    giving team sufficient confidence to introduce an intern's patches into production.

  % skills: Data Visualisation, Grafana, BigQuery, SQL
  % soft-skills: teamwork
  \item Designed Grafana Dashboard to visualise Feast usage metrics in BigQuery which aided the project manager \& technical lead in their decision making.

  % skills: Data Visualisation, Grafana, BigQuery, SQL
