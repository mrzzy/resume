\section{Experience}
\experience{Machine Learning Engineer Intern}{Gojek}{Mar 2020}{Oct 2020}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identified \& swiftly resolved a with production issue with Feast, the Machine Learning
      feature database that powers Gojek's driver-passenger matchmaking model.
      An issue with Feast's Redis data encoding causing production downtime and 
      costing the company's bottom line. Quickly wrote \& deployed a patch to bring Feast back up.
    \item Unblocked Feast's authentication roll out by delivering
      support in Java \& Golang clients for Feast
      Authentication was sorely needed to provide access controls for better data governance.
    \item Management planning Feast's future lacked observability into Feast usage. Governance
        Designed \& implemented a Grafana dashboard using metrics computed on 
        BigQuery SQL to help management make informed decisions.
\end{itemize}

\experience{Software Engineer Intern}{Tinkertanker}{Jan 2018}{Apr 2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rewrote aging Google Sheets instructor-course allocation system in Python, Django, PostgreSQL to resolve longstanding performance issues.
    Designed \& implemented a new user interface for the system with Jinja, HTML, JavaScript for smooth User Experience (UX).
  \item Enforced Software Engineering best practices including Test Driven Development,
    documentation, continuous integration (CI). Prolonged the longevity of the project
    past 5 years and counting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Projects}
\project{Providence}{github.com/mrzzy/providence}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automated tedious, error prone manual accounting in the YNAB app by writing a routine ETL data pipeline to import SG bank transactions. 
    Freed up time on weekends to work on hobbies and improved data quality by avoiding data entry errors.
  \item Enriched opaque, Public Transport billing bank transactions that lumped multiple trips together with individual trip details by scraping details from a website with Rust.
    Provided ability to drill down lump bank transactions into individual trips for additional context when accounting.
  \item Visualised savings \& cash flow with Apache Superset dashboard to give greater insight into financial health. Assists in budgeting for future expenses.
  \item Created accounting aide that used transaction heuristic to match YNAB \& bank transactions. Saved manual scrolling to needed look for \& match transactions.
\end{itemize}

\project{WARP}{github.com/mrzzy/warp}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Engineered Google Cloud Platform (GCP) hosted development environment with Ansible, Packer, Terraform that was ready-to-go within minutes of pressing a button. 
    SSH \& Web browser access gave flexibility to code anywhere: on an iPad, mobile phone, or a public computer.
  \item Streamlined development toolchain upgrades by integrating Renovate to provide dependency upgrades and Github Actions to test \& accept non-breaking upgrades. Greatly reduced the maintains workload required to keep development toolchain up to date.
\end{itemize}
  
\section{Education}
\experience{Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science}{Nanyang Technological University}{Apr 2023}{Apr 2027}
\experience{Diploma in Information Technology}{Ngee Ann Polytechnic}{Apr 2018}{Apr 2021}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ported open source Content Management System (CMS) to Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration.
