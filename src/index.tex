\section{Education}
\experience{Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science}{Nanyang Technological University}{Apr 2023}{Apr 2027}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Collaborated with club members to maintain backend responsible for safekeeping school club's merchandise sales data with Node.js \& TypeScript.
\end{itemize}
\experience{Diploma in Information Technology}{Ngee Ann Polytechnic}{Apr 2018}{Apr 2021}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Supported programming contest with over 40 participants by deploying online judge use to evaluate participant solutions on AWS with Kubernetes \& Docker.
  \item Organized \& conducted a 6 part Machine Learning  (ML) workshop for technology interest club to engage members in ML.
\end{itemize}


\section{Experience}
\experience{Machine Learning Engineer Intern}{Gojek}{Mar 2020}{Oct 2020}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resolved production issue causing system downtime by patching data schema. Service degradation affected a critical downstream system.
    \item 
        Designed \& implemented a analytics dashboard with Grafana, Google Cloud (GCP) BigQuery and SQL. Assisted management in making informed decisions during project planning.
    \item Wrote authentication support for SDKs relied on by internal clients in Golang \& Java for enhanced data security.
\end{itemize}

\experience{Software Engineer Intern}{Tinkertanker}{Jan 2018}{Apr 2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Collaborated on a rewrite aging Google Sheets instructor-course allocation system in Python, Django, PostgreSQL to 
 /media/mrzzy/Backup/pickle/lock.exclusive   resolve longstanding performance issues. 
  \item Designed \& implemented a new user interface 
    for the system with Jinja, HTML, JavaScript for smooth User Experience (UX).
  \item Enforced Software Engineering best practices including Test Driven Development,
    documentation. Wrote Github actions continuous integration (CI). 
    Prolonged the longevity of the project past 5 years and counting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Projects}

\experience{Providence}{Personal}{Mar 2023}{July 2023}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automated manual accounting a with a ELT data pipeline built with Pandas, DBT \& AWS Redshift Data Warehouse to import bank transactions into accounting system. Improved data quality by avoiding data entry errors.
  \item Visualised savings \& cash flow with Apache Superset dashboard to give greater insight into financial health. Assists in budgeting for future expenses.
  \item Created accounting aide that used transaction heuristic to match accounting \& bank transactions. Saved time needed to manually search for matching transactions.
\end{itemize}

\experience{WARP}{Personal}{May 2022}{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Engineered GCP hosted Linux coding environment accessible on any device deployed using Terraform,
    Packer Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
  \item Streamlined toolchain upgrades by integrating Renovate dependency manager to provide automatic upgrades. Reduced maintenance workload required to keep development toolchain up to date.
\end{itemize}
\experience{Bentobox}{Ngee Ann Polytechnic (Final Year Project)}{Nov 2020}{Mar 2021}
\begin{itemize}
\item Achieved remote execution of Python code on C++ runtime by design a gRPC protocol. Fused the simplicity of Python to performance of C++.
\item Crafted a compiler that parsed a subset of Python into a graph that could be executed on a external C++ runtime.
\end{itemize}
