% Summary
Undergraduate Computer Science major seeking opportunities to building software systems at scale.

\section{Experience}
\experience{Machine Learning Engineer Intern}{Gojek}{Mar 2020}{Oct 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintained open source Machine Learning (ML) Feature Store with Python, Java, Golang, Kafka \& Redis. Feature store was responsible for supplying data for both ML training \& inference.
  \item Resolved production issue causing system downtime by patching Redis data schema. Service degradation affected a critical downstream system.
  \item 
      Designed \& implemented a analytics dashboard with Grafana, Google Cloud (GCP) BigQuery Data Warehouse and SQL. Assisted management in making informed decisions during project planning.
\end{itemize}

\experience{Software Engineer Intern}{Tinkertanker}{Jan 2018}{Apr 2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Collaborated on a rewrite aging Google Sheets instructor-course allocation system in Python, Django, PostgreSQL to 
    resolve longstanding performance issues. 
  \item Designed \& implemented a new user interface 
    for the system with Jinja, HTML, JavaScript for smooth User Experience (UX).
  \item Enforced Software Engineering best practices including Test Driven Development,
    documentation. Wrote Github actions continuous integration (CI). 
    Prolonged the longevity of the project past 5 years and counting.
\end{itemize}


\section{Projects}
\experience{Providence}{Personal}{Mar 2023}{July 2023}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automated manual with engineering Extract Load Transform (ETL) data pipeline with with Python, SQL, DBT \& AWS Redshift Data Warehouse ochestrated with Apache Airflow to import \& transform bank transactions from accounting system. Improved data quality by avoiding data entry errors.
  \item Integrated transport data from SimplyGo by developing custom data source. Enriched accounting data by providing more insights into transport spending.
  \item Visualised savings \& cash flow with Apache Superset dashboard to give greater insight into financial health. Dashboard provided crucial guidance for budgeting future expenses.
\end{itemize}
\experience{WARP}{Personal}{May 2022}{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Engineered GCP hosted Linux coding environment accessible on any device deployed using Terraform,
    Packer Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
  \item Streamlined toolchain upgrades by integrating Renovate dependency manager to provide automatic upgrades. Reduced maintenance workload required to keep development toolchain up to date.
\end{itemize}
\experience{Bentobox}{Ngee Ann Polytechnic (Final Year Project)}{Nov 2020}{Mar 2021}
\begin{itemize}
\item Achieved remote execution of Python code on C++ runtime by design a gRPC protocol. Fused the simplicity of Python to performance of C++.
\item Crafted a compiler that parsed a subset of Python into a graph that could be executed on a external C++ runtime.
\end{itemize}

\section{Education}
\experience{Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science}{Nanyang Technological University}{Apr 2023}{Apr 2027}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Transformed 8GB JSON Yelp Dataset into a Parquet One Big Table suitable for Data Science with Apache Spark on Databricks. Dataset was too big to be processed on a single machine.
  \item Maintained club's merchandise sales backend with Node.js \& TypeScript. Club activities primarily funded by merchandise sales.
\end{itemize}
\experience{Diploma in Information Technology}{Ngee Ann Polytechnic}{Apr 2018}{Apr 2021}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Supported programming contest with over 40 participants by deploying online judge use to evaluate participant solutions on AWS with Kubernetes \& Docker.
  \item Organized \& conducted a 6 part Machine Learning  (ML) workshop for technology interest club to engage members in ML.
\end{itemize}
  
\section{Skills}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, Cloud Computing, GCP, AWS, Terraform, Docker, Ansible, Packer, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Github Actions, Redis, PostgreSQL, Grafana, DBT, Linux, Redshift, BigQuery, Airflow, Spark, Big Data
  \item Self Driven, Self Starter, Analytical, Collaborative, Ambitious, Curious, Result Oriented, Committed, Problem Solver
\end{itemize}
